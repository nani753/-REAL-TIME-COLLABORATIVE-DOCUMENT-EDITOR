The Real‑Time Collaborative Document Editor is a feature-rich web application enabling multiple users to seamlessly edit shared documents simultaneously within a clean, intuitive interface. Leveraging a modern full-stack architecture, the app combines a React frontend and NestJS backend to deliver real-time collaboration powered by WebSocket gateways (Socket.IO). The frontend incorporates robust state management using Context API and stylish, responsive design with TailwindCSS, while the backend uses NestJS modules for authentication, authorization, document management, and user handling—complete with JWT-based security and Mongoose schemas for data modeling. Users can register, log in, create documents, and instantly see collaborators’ edits in real time thanks to efficient WebSocket synchronization and conflict resolution strategies. Document changes are persisted in MongoDB (hosted on Mongo Atlas), ensuring reliability and data integrity across sessions. Additional backend features include DTO validation/transformations, WebSocket client-to-database user mappings, and runtime guards to protect API endpoints. The project’s scalable module structure organizes code into clear concerns such as auth, user, document, and socket.gateway, providing maintainability and enabling easy feature extensions. Accompanied by detailed reporting and demo videos, this project demonstrates advanced web development skills in full-stack communication, real-time event handling, and collaborative UX design, making it an ideal starting point for anyone building Google Docs–style applications or implementing real-time features in their own platforms
